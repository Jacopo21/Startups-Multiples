# Startups_multiples
Little but hopefully successful attempt to forecast success of a start-up given a comprehensive dataset gathered from Crunchbase

The dataset is composed of the following variables: 
- 'Organization Name',
- 'Organization Name URL',
- 'Growth Category',
- 'IPO Status',
- 'Company Type', 
- 'Website', -> to be dropped
'Number of Employees',
'Acquisition Status',
'Last Funding Type',
'Last Funding Date',
'Industries',
'Headquarters Location',
'Description',
'CB Rank (Company)',
'Investor Type',
'Founded Date',
'Founded Date Precision',
'Operating Status',
'Actively Hiring',
'Investment Stage',
'Number of Founders',
'Number of Funding Rounds',
'Funding Status',
'Last Funding Amount',
'Last Funding Amount Currency',
'Last Funding Amount (in USD)',
'Last Equity Funding Amount',
'Last Equity Funding Amount Currency',
'Last Equity Funding Amount (in USD)',
'Last Equity Funding Type',
'Total Equity Funding Amount',
'Total Equity Funding Amount Currency',
'Total Equity Funding Amount (in USD)',
'Total Funding Amount',
'Total Funding Amount Currency',
'Total Funding Amount (in USD)',
'Top 5 Investors',
'Number of Investors'

The work for now should focus on feature engineering in order to extract as much information as possible. 
The target variable could be Total Funding Amount (in USD) which represents the total amount of funding in US dollars.
